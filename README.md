# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## What have I used ?
1- I used flexbox to display my elements like the way they do on design patterns.
2- It was really hard for me to understand how to make a accordion page only little js nowladge but I think I handled it by the help of js DOM.

# Thanks for your visit :)
This is my first project that I have used all 3 frontend technologies at the sametime. I hope you would like it :)
-happy coding!!
