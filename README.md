# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

# Thanks for your visit :)
This is my first project that I have used all 3 frontend technologies at the sametime. I hope you would like it :)

## What have I used ?
1- I used flexbox to display my elements like the way they do on design patterns.
2- I used classic HTML DOM to make the accordion page.

happy coding!!
